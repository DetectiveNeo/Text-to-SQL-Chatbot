Vector Embeddings

Raw Structure that needs to be embedded

Table: orders
Columns:
- order_id (INTEGER)
- customer_id (INTEGER)
- order_date (DATE)
- total_amount (FLOAT)

Local / embedded vector stores (MOST projects)
    FAISS (Used in this project)
    Chroma (local mode)

    FAISS : Facebook AI Similarity Search
        Store vectors
        Index them intelligently
        Search for nearest neighbors very fast

Returen the top k vector store embedding indices which matches with the query
indices = [[4, 0, 7]]
distances = [[0.12, 0.45, 0.88]]

FAISS index 0  <--> metadata[0]
FAISS index 1  <--> metadata[1]


Industry rule of thumb

__init__ should initialize, not restore.

Restoring state from disk is a separate concern.
